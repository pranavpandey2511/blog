Expertise: Open to learning more.
Creating AI tools and products that are going to have huge impact at a very large scale, is what I am after.
I am a Computer Vision/Deep Learning engineer with thorough understanding and experience of software development life-cycle.

I like to work on designing deep learning systems (especially computer vision) with a mix of other areas image processing, signal processing, etc.
I have previously worked on projects related to image classification, object detection, object tracking, image super-resolution, image segmentation, audio classification, zero-shot and few-shot learning methods, model explain-ability (understanding), edge (mobile) device model deployment, cloud deployment (Google cloud/ AWS), and a lot more.

Excellent knowledge of modern computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.

Topics: Image Classification , Object Detection and localisation, Pose Estimation, Image Processing, SIFT, SURF,AKAZE, ORB, Image Homography, SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping) (implemented 2-D graphSLAM),Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTMs, Generative adversarial networks(GANs), Autoencoders (VAEs/Beta-VAEs)

Languages: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL (Postgres), JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Frameworks: PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, FastAI, Turicreate, PyTest, Flask, Django, FastAPIDeveloper

Tools: Git, Docker, Jupyter, MLFlow, WandB, Tensorboard, TensorRT, Streamlit, Google Cloud Platform,Azure (learning), VS Code, VIM, PyCharm, Eclipse

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-Image, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
